# VisibleGov — TODO / Backlog

*How to use: dump raw ideas in INBOX anytime. We triage from there into real work.*

## NOW

- [x] ~~Lance reviews the MVP design draft~~ (approved as working draft 2026-07-27)
- [x] ~~Execute Plan 1: foundation + ingestion (Onder slice)~~ — **COMPLETE 2026-07-27.** All
  10 tasks done + review-approved on branch `slice1-foundation-ingestion` (pushed): scaffold,
  typed errors + rate limiter, additive-merge DB layer, schema migration SQL (Lance applied),
  Congress.gov adapter, OpenStates/MO adapter, dry-run-capable ingest CLI, live end-to-end
  ingest + verification. Live run: `us-congress` rolls 358-362/2025 (5 votes, 2165 casts, 0
  failures) + `mo-legislature` session 2022 page 1 (95 votes, 20 bills, 0 casts — confirmed
  OpenStates gap, 0 failures); both `status: "succeeded"`. Onder verified end-to-end in the
  live DB via Supabase REST: federal row (bioguide_id `O000177`) with 5 vote_casts (one per
  ingested roll), separate MO row (openstates_id) with 1 synthesized senate/district-2 term;
  re-ran the MO ingest to confirm idempotency (no duplicate terms or votes). Full detail in
  CHATLOG. Next: Plan 2 (summarization + review queue).
- [ ] Decision for Lance before Plan 2: published summaries' `editor_notes` column would be
  publicly readable under current RLS — keep internal (column-split or clear-on-publish)?

## 🛠 BUILD QUEUE

1. [x] ~~First vertical slice: Bob Onder end-to-end — ingestion half~~ **DONE 2026-07-27.**
   Ingested live from both jurisdictions and verified end-to-end (see TODO NOW + CHATLOG). The
   remaining half of this slice (summarize the triggered bills → review queue → published
   legislator page) is items 5-7 below, deferred to Plans 2-3.
2. [x] ~~Schema migration draft (canonical tables + RLS)~~ **DONE** — applied by Lance,
   confirmed live via Supabase REST probe (jurisdictions + sessions seed present).
3. [x] ~~Congress.gov adapter (bills, actions, calendars, roll-call XML)~~ **DONE** —
   live-verified (Tasks 6 and 10).
4. [x] ~~OpenStates/MO adapter~~ **DONE** — live-verified (Tasks 8 and 10). Known gap:
   OpenStates MO vote events carry no per-voter casts (confirmed 0/95 twice, in fixture and
   live) — see item 9.
5. Summarization CLI (versioned prompt, hash-tied to bill text version, review queue).
6. Public site: directory, legislator page, bill page, address lookup (Census Geocoder).
7. Staff `/admin` review queue.
8. Identity merge: link federal+MO legislator rows (Onder currently = 2 rows — one keyed by
   `bioguide_id`, one by `openstates_id` — confirmed live 2026-07-27; expected until this is
   built, not a bug).
9. MO official-journal scraper for individual roll-call votes (OpenStates has none) — confirmed
   twice (Task 7 fixture, Task 10 live run: 0 vote_casts across 95 MO vote events).

## 📥 INBOX (raw idea capture, 2026-07-27, Lance's own words)

> "I'd like to expose all the politicians by breaking down the bills and laws they propose into
> layman terms so that everyone can easily read them and their purpose and then we can all see how
> our constituents voted on said bills so we can hold them accountable as they are CLEARLY running
> amuck these days"

Multi-faceted per Lance: (1) plain-language bill/law breakdowns, (2) purpose/intent surfaced
clearly, (3) voting-record tracking tied to individual legislators, (4) accountability - making the
above easy enough that regular people actually use it. Decomposed 2026-07-27 into the MVP design
draft — see NOW.
